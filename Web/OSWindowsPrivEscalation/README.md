# What is this?
a step by step guide to preform Windows related privilege escalation from limited shell into SYSTEM abusing misconfigurations and local exploits.
We call it "WPECS" for short and can be accessed at [AddaxSoft.com/WPECS](https://addaxsoft.com/wpecs) with a dark and easy to read theme.

## Format and Rules
- We use 4 spaces until I figure out how to turn tabs on (yes, I'm a tab guy)
- 3 lines feeds before each headline H1
- 2 line feeds before each headline H2
- each major section (e.g. OS Enumuration) is a headline H1
- each section (e.g searching passwords in fiels under looting for clear text passwords) is a headline H2
- After each "chunk" of the document we add an html <br> (break) using
- If we ever use screenshots we try to be as specific as possible, animated gifs are even better.


## Tips
- you can use `[Another section](#new-section)` to reffer to a headline (e.g [this](#Format-and-Rules) will reffer to Format and rules)
